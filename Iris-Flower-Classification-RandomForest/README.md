📌 Description: This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using the Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples and 4 numerical features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

🔍 Project Objectives: Load and explore the Iris dataset

Visualize feature relationships using Seaborn pairplots

Preprocess and split data into training and testing sets

Train a Random Forest classifier

Evaluate model performance using accuracy score and classification report

Analyze and visualize feature importance

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used: 🐍 Python

📊 Pandas, NumPy

🎨 Seaborn, Matplotlib

🤖 Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, metrics)

📈 Model Performance: Achieved over 95% accuracy on the test set.

Feature importance plot shows that petal length and petal width are the most influential features in predicting the flower species.

🎯 Key Takeaways: Learned how to implement and evaluate a supervised machine learning classification task.

Gained hands-on experience with data visualization, model training, testing, and feature analysis.

Built a reproducible and interpretable ML workflow suitable for real-world datasets.
